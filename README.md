# Diabetes-Prediction-
Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning This project uses machine learning models to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various health metrics. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.
# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical diagnostic data. It uses a Streamlit-based web interface for interactive predictions.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains several medical predictors and one target variable (`Outcome`) indicating whether a person has diabetes.

## 📁 Features
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age

## ✅ Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- (You can add others if used)

## 🚀 Deployment
- Deployed using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io)
- Live demo: *(Add your deployed app link once live)*

## 💻 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
